    the lead in Raghavendra. In 2004, he appeared in Varsham and Adavi Raamudu.
    He received his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor –
    Telugu for his performance in the former. In 2005, he appeared in Chakram
    and in the film Chatrapathi, directed by S. S. Rajamouli, in which he

    third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. In 2010, he
    appeared in the romantic comedy Darling which received positive reviews upon
    release. The Times of India gave a 2.5 star rating explaining "Director
    Karunakaran extracts good performances from his actors, but can't come up
    with a refreshing plot. It looks like the director hasn't really come out of
    his Tholi Prema hangover as he dishes out yet another one-sided love saga
    but fails to come up with a valid and logical reason to make a GenZ lad to
    hold back his feelings for his lover until the last moment. However, he
    compensates it all, by adding loads of fun moments in the film and the
    screenplay does have its share of some touching moments."[27] In 2011, he
    appeared in another romantic comedy Mr. Perfect. The review site GreatAndhra
    rated the film with three stars and noted "The film comes across as a clean,
    family entertainer and the intention of the makers must be appreciated.[28]
    His performance in the film earned him his fourth nomination for the
    Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. In 2012, Prabhas starred in Rebel,
    an action film directed by Raghava Lawrence. Sashidhar from The Times of
    India stated, "The film belongs to hard-core Prabhas fans as the movie is
    stylish and visually rich but not much in content".[29] Purnima Ranawat from
    NDTV said, "Rebel serves up fare for the mass audience. The film will be
    definitely liked by Prabhas' fans. Watch it for the dancing talent of
    Tamannaah Bhatia and action skills of Prabhas."[30] Radhika Rajamani from
    Rediff.com gave the movie 1.5 stars out of five and said, "Working with
    hardly any storyline, director Raghava Lawrence had made a film that is
    arduous to watch... Rebel is a movie for the masses and certainly not for
    the discerning audience."[31] He also rendered voice for a short cameo for
    the film Denikaina Ready (2012).[32] In 2013, Prabhas starred in Mirchi.
    Jeevi of Idlebrain.com gave a rating of 3.25 out of 5, commenting that
    "First half of Mirchi is decent. Flashback episodes which occupies the
    lion's share of the second half is good. Climax could have been better. The
    plus points of the film are Prabhas, music and all-round orientation. On a
    whole, Mirchi has all the ingredients of a commercial potboiler".[33] Mahesh
    S Koneru gave his verdict that "At the box office, the film will turn in a
    good commercial performance", giving the film a score of 3.25/5.[34]
    Way2movies also gave a rating of 3.25/5, giving the verdict that "Prabhas
    rocks the show in this decent yet formulaic commercial entertainer".[35]
    SuperGoodMovies gave the film 3 stars in a scale of 5, reviewing that "Go
    and Watch Mirchi, It entertains both class and mass. It is a worth
    watch."[36] His performance in the film earned him his fifth nomination for
    the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. He then made his Hindi cinema
    debut in 2014 in the special dance number "Punjabi Mast" from the film
    Action Jackson.[37] 2015–2017: Pan-India success Prabhas on the sets of
    Baahubali 2: The Conclusion In 2015, Prabhas played a dual role as
    Shivudu/Mahendra Baahubali and Amarendra Baahubali in S.S. Rajamouli's epic
    action drama Baahubali: The Beginning (2015). With a budget of ₹180 crore
    ($28 million), it was the most expensive Indian film ever made at the time
    of release,[38] and became a record-breaking box office success. The film
    eventually grossed over ₹600 crore (US$72 million) worldwide, making it the
    highest-grossing Telugu film and the second highest-grossing Indian film at

    ₹1,810 crore (US$220 million) worldwide, making it second-highest-grossing
    Indian film worldwide to date and the highest-grossing film in India till
    date.[43][44][45] Prabhas dedicated five years for the duology as he states
    that the project demanded a certain level of dedication.[46] He increased
    his weight to 105 kg for Amarendra Baahubali's character.[47] He won the
    SIIMA Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in The
    Conclusion.[48] His performance in both film earned him his sixth and
    seventh nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. The
    success of Baahubali propelled Prabhas to become the first “Pan-Indian
    star”, receiving significant following across India.[49][50]
