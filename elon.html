Childhood and family
Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital.[8][9] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[10][11] His mother, Maye Musk (née Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.[12][13][14] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at the Timbavati Private Nature Reserve.[15][16][17][18] Elon has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.[14][19] Elon has four paternal half-siblings.[20][21][22]

The family was wealthy during Elon's youth.[18] Despite both Musk and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine,[18] in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive "a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines."[23][24] Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.[8]

Elon's maternal grandfather, Joshua N. Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane; Haldeman died when Elon was still a toddler.[21][25][26][27]

Elon has recounted trips to a wilderness school ("veldskool") that he described as a "paramilitary Lord of the Flies" where "bullying was a virtue" and children were encouraged to fight over rations.[28]

After his parents divorced in 1980, Elon chose to live primarily with his father.[10][15] Elon later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[29] Elon attended Bryanston High School.[30] In one incident, after an altercation with a fellow student, Elon was thrown down concrete steps and beaten severely by the boy and his friends, leading to him being hospitalized for his injuries.[31] Elon described his father berating him after he was discharged from the hospital, saying "I had to stand for an hour as he yelled at me and called me an idiot and told me that <u>I was just worthless".[31] Errol denied berating Elon but claimed "The boy had just lost his father to suicide and Elon had called him stupid</u>. Elon had a tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?"[32] After the attack, Elon was enrolled in private school.[31][32]

Elon was an enthusiastic reader of books, later attributing his success in part to having read The Lord of the Rings, the Foundation series, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.[17][33] At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual.[34] At age twelve, Elon sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[35][36]

Education

Musk graduated from Pretoria Boys High School in South Africa
Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated.[37] Musk was a good but not exceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification.[38] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother,[39][40] knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States this way.[41] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[42]

Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a second cousin in Saskatchewan,[43] and worked odd jobs including at a farm and a lumber mill.[44] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[45][46]

Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League university in Philadelphia, where he earned two degrees: a Bachelor of Arts in physics, and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the university's Wharton School. Although Musk has said that he earned the degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997.[51][48][52] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.[53]

In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.[54][55] In 1995, he was accepted to a graduate program in materials science at Stanford University, but did not enroll.[48][52] Musk decided to join the Internet boom, applying for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.[56][39]

<h2>Business career</h2><hr>
In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Global Link Information Network, later renamed to Zip2.[57][58] The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.[59] They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto,[60] with Musk coding the website every night.[60] Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.[53] The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch;[61] however, Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted.[62] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[63][64] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.[65]

X.com and PayPal
Main articles: X.com (bank), PayPal, and PayPal Mafia
In March 1999,[66] Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company with $12 million of the money he made from the Compaq acquisition.[67] X.com was one of the first federally insured online banks, and <u>over 200,000 customers joined in its initial months of operation.</u>[68]

Even though Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[69]

In 2000, X.com merged with the online bank Confinity to avoid competition,[60][69][70] as the latter's money-transfer service PayPal was more popular than X.com's service.[71] Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company. His preference for Microsoft- over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company's employees, and eventually led Confinity <mark>co-founder Peter Thiel to resign.[72] With the company suffering from compounding technological issues and the lack of a cohesive business model</mark>, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[73][b] Under Thiel, the company focused on the money-transfer service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[75][76]

Musk shakes hands with In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow, Russia with Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. <u>He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras</u>; however, Musk was seen as a novice[83] and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia with Mike Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[83] With $100 million of his own money,[84] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer.[85][86]

<mark>SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.</mark>[87] Though the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA Administrator (and former SpaceX consultant[88]) Mike Griffin later that year.[89][90] After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to go bankrupt,[87] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.[91] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS), replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[92] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.[93]

Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on a land platform.[94] Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform.[95] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[96][97] Since 2019,[98] SpaceX has been developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy.[99] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.[100] In 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX an $843 million contract to deorbit the ISS at the end of its lifespan.[101]
